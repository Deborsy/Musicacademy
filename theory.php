			<h2>Origin of music</h2>
			<h3>How Music and Instruments Began:</h3><br> A Brief Overview of the Origin and Entire Development of Music, from Its Earliest Stages
			Music must first be defined and distinguished from speech, and from animal and bird cries. We discuss the stages of hominid anatomy that permit music to be perceived and created, with the likelihood of both Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens both being capable. The earlier hominid ability to emit sounds of variable pitch with some meaning shows that music at its simplest level must have predated speech. The possibilities of anthropoid motor impulse suggest that rhythm may have preceded melody, though full control of rhythm may well not have come any earlier than the perception of music above. There are four evident purposes for music: dance, ritual, entertainment personal, and communal, and above all social cohesion, again on both personal and communal levels.
			<p><strong>Have</strong> we talked about the history of musical instruments. Some of the things we believed due to history. Let's talk
			<h1>History Of Musical Instruments</h1>
			 We then proceed to how instruments began, with a brief survey of the surviving examples from the Mousterian period onward, including the possible Neanderthal evidence and the extent to which they showed “artistic” potential in other fields. We warn that our performance on replicas of surviving instruments may bear little or no resemblance to that of the original players. We continue with how later instruments, strings, and skin-drums began and developed into instruments we know in worldwide cultures today. The sound of music is then discussed, scales and intervals, and the lack of any consistency of consonant tonality around the world. This is followed by iconographic evidence of the instruments of later antiquity into the European Middle Ages, and finally, the history of public performance, again from the possibilities of early humanity into more modern times. This paper draws the ethnomusicological perspective on the entire development of music, instruments, and performance, from the times of H.

		<h1>Definition Of Music</h1>
		<h3>What Is Music?</h3>
		<P>Have you ever wondered the meaning of music? No? Really? MUSIC can be defined in many ways:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Music can be said to be a sound that is agreeable to the ear. That is one of the most commom definitions noted by people.</li>
					<li>
					vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.</li>
				<li>	
				An art of sound in time that expresses ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, and color.</li>
				<li>
				The tones or sounds employed, occurring in single line (melody) or multiple lines (harmony), and sounded or to be sounded by one or more voices or instruments, or both.</li>
				<li>
					Music is a musical work or compositions for singing or playing.</li>
			</ul>
				<strong>T</strong>hose are some definition that you can say about music. If you know more then that's cool for you. Keep it up! But for me that's all I can say and all you need to know for now.
		</P><br><br>
		<h1>Do You Know?</h1> That music is made up of something known as musical notes and they can be listed below: As in below
		<ul>
			<li>Breve (Mostly not used)</li>
			<li>Semi Breve</li>
			<li>minim</li>
			<li>Crotchet</li>
			<li>Quaver</li>
			<li>Semi Quaver</li>
			<li>Demi Semi Quaver</li>
			<li>Hemi Demi Semi Quaver(Mostly not used)</li>
		</ul><br>
		Now that we know that music consist or is made up of musical notes which has different BEATS ohh! I forgot to tell you the values of those note. Ok let's check it out:
		<ul>
			<li>Breve (8 beats)</li>
			<li>Semi Breve (4 beats)</li>
			<li>minim (2 beats)</li>
			<li>Crotchet (1 beat)</li>
			<li>Quaver (1/2 beat)</li>
			<li>Semi Quaver (1/4 beat)</li>
			<li>Demi Semi Quaver (1/8 beat)</li>
			<li>Hemi Demi Semi Quaver (1/16 beat)</li>
		</ul><br>
		<strong>We have three main keys in music they are called THE ACCIDENTALS.</strong>They are listed below:
		<ul>
			<li>Sharps (7)</li>
			<li>Flats(7)</li>
			<li>Natural(1)</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>These three keys now determine if the pitch of our song will go higher or will be flatened or be at a normal pitch.</strong>
		<P><h2>Sharps:</h2> Sharp is an accidental that raises a song or pitch by a semitone.</P>
